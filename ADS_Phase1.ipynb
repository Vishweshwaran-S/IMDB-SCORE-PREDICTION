        "•\tGathering a dataset of IMDb movies that includes features such as movie title, director, genre, release year, cast, budget, runtime, and any other relevant information. IMDb had provided the datasets for this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **2. Data Preprocessing:**\n",
        "•\tCleaning and preprocessing the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting categorical variables into a suitable format for modelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **3. Feature Engineering:**\n",
        "•\tExtracting meaningful features from the data that might influence IMDb scores. features are the number of A-list actors in the cast, the director's previous success, and the movie's budget relative to its genre.\n",

        "# **9. Model Interpretability:**\n",
